-- In here the trait of the Crownlands is defined.
-- The Crownlands can force citystates to pledge their allegiance, which means engaging a alliance.
-- This can be achieved when:
--  - the city state has no other allies yet
--  - at least 3 military units are next to the border of the citystate
--  - The citystate is "feared" (military power is big enough)
